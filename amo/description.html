Browser extension for reopening a private tab as a regular tab, and vice versa. 

This extension was forked from <a
href="https://github.com/cpeterso/open-page-in-private-window">cpeterso/open-page-in-private-window/</a>
as it provided a reasonable base to build from. It has been updated to Manifest
V3 to support multiple browsers in theory, but has only been tested on Firefox.

<b>Note: You must allow this extension in Private Windows.</b>
