      Thanks for installing the Escalate Private Tab extension! Note that it
      won't work unless you tell your browser to allow it to run in Private
      Windows.

      <strong>Note:</strong> you'll see this window after your first install. If
      you see it again when you press the toolbar button, it's because you
      haven't granted the permission mentioned above!
