# Escalate Private Tab

Browser extension for reopening a private tab as a regular tab, and vice versa. 

This extension was forked from [cpeterso/open-page-in-private-window][fork] as
it provided a reasonable base to build from. It has been updated to Manifest V3
to support multiple browsers in theory, but has only been tested on Firefox.

[fork]: https://github.com/cpeterso/open-page-in-private-window

This was created as Firefox for Android supports opening links in private
windows by default, but there's no convenient way to reopen the tab in a
non-private context when necessary.
